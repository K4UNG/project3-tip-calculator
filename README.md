## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my first project where I use JavaScript so things that I didn't know are just keep coming out and I learned a lot about DOM manipulation.

### Continued development

I will learn more JavaScript as I now know what my level is along with CSS.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This website has been really helpful along my web programming journey. It's almost like a wiki for web development.
- [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Whenever I want to do something but I don't know how, I always end up here. It's a life-saver for pretty much all of my projects that include coding.
